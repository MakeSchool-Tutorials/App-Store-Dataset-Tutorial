Welcome! This tutorial is built to take folks with a **baseline understanding of statistics** and give them an introduction to a beginner's analysis of a dataset.

If you already have Anaconda, Python 3+, and Jupyter Notebooks installed on your computer and you feel comfortable manipulating those, you can skip to the next chapter, otherwise finish the following two steps.

# What Tools Will We Use?

In this tutorial, we're only going to be focusing on setting up and establishing our workspace for working with intermediate and advanced Python tools - like Jupyter, Anaconda, and accessory libraries like Pandas and MatPlotLib.

Anaconda comes installed with:

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Accessory Python Libraries
- Visual Studio Code
- And it ensures Python is up-to-date (we will be using Python 3+!).

# Installing Anaconda

Please follow this tutorial to install Anaconda on your computer:

# Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are an industry standard for simultaneously manipulating and publishing data. They are an incredible tool and we are super lucky to have them starting day one of your learning computational statistics and data science.

Watch this video and follow along with it. By the end, you should have created a Jupyter notebook that looks like the one in the video.
